                        Alec Weidner is a third year computer science student with a minor in information systems. Alec is the VP of the club tennis team here at Loyola and apart of the travel team. He is primarily interested in the front-end dev and overall analytics aspect of these fields, thus leading to the finance tracker application. This being the first time he is entirely in charge financially, Alec thought a finance tracker for this project fit fairly well. He is from the suburbs of Illinois and enjoys gaming and playing sports in his free time.
