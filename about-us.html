                        Hello! My name is Alec Weidner and I am a Junior here at Loyola studying Computer Science and Information Systems. I find myself fairly interested in the data science and analytics focus of these fields, that primarily being the reason we chose to create a finance tracker application! Throughout college, I have found myself struggling to manage my money, as this is the first time in my life that I have been entirely in-charge financially. I believe our website will be benefical to all college students, as majority of students were never taught how to budget/finance money properly! I hope you find our application as useful as we do!
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li class="box bText">
                    <P>
                        I would recommend adding a link to the Home page at the top alongside the ‘About Us’, ‘Expense Quizzes’, and ‘Contact Us’ options, so that when the user goes to one of those other navigations, they have a straightforward way of coming back to the home page, without having to have the intuition of knowing that clicking the name of the application usually takes the user home
                    </P>

                        I believe Hayward had brought up the question of how the calculations for the percentages on the Financial Breakdown and Our Recommendations pie charts would be done, and I believe your group mentioned algorithms? I could be remembering that wrong, so apologies if that is the case. I would check out Hayward’s feedback regarding that part of your project since I get the feeling he will cover that in his feedback. If he doesn’t, and you get to that part and have questions, just let us know!
                    </p>

                        Overall, your group is already off to a good start with your project. You have some good mockups, and a clear scope for what you want to achieve for the final. I look forward to seeing how your group’s project progresses throughout the rest of this semester.
                    </P>
