                        Hello! My name is Alec Weidner and I am a Junior here at Loyola studying Computer Science and Information Systems. I find myself fairly interested in the data science and analytics focus of these fields, that primarily being the reason we chose to create a finance tracker application! Throughout college, I have found myself struggling to manage my money, as this is the first time in my life that I have been entirely in-charge financially. I believe our website will be benefical to all college students, as majority of students were never taught how to budget/finance money properly! I hope you find our application as useful as we do!
                    </p>

                       Emily is a third year computer science student with a minor in information systems. On campus she is a member of the Chi Omega sorority and of the Women in Math and Science Club. Originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, Emily enjoys all things outdoors including hiking and surfing. We are very excited about this project and we hope that It helps everyone!
